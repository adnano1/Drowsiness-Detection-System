Project Title: Drowsiness Detection System Using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi
Overview
The Drowsiness Detection System is designed to monitor a user's alertness by analyzing their facial expressions and eye movements using computer vision techniques. This system utilizes OpenCV, a Raspberry Pi camera, and a Media Pi framework to detect signs of drowsiness in real-time. When drowsiness is detected, the system can alert the user through visual or auditory signals.

Features
Real-time detection of drowsiness
Alerts when drowsiness is detected
Lightweight and efficient, running on Raspberry Pi
User-friendly interface for easy operation
Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi (any model with camera support)
Raspberry Pi Camera Module
USB Power Supply for Raspberry Pi
(Optional) Buzzer or LED for alerts
Software Requirements
Raspbian OS installed on Raspberry Pi
Python 3.x
OpenCV library
NumPy library
Mediapipe library
Installation
Set up Raspberry Pi:

Install Raspbian OS on your Raspberry Pi.
Update the package list:
bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
Install Required Libraries:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt install python3-opencv
pip install numpy mediapipe
Clone the Repository: Clone the project repository to your Raspberry Pi:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd drowsiness-detection
Connect the Camera: Connect the Raspberry Pi Camera module and enable it using the Raspberry Pi Configuration settings.

Run the Application: Execute the main script:

bash
Copy code
python3 drowsiness_detection.py
Usage
Position the user in front of the camera.
The system will begin analyzing the userâ€™s facial features for drowsiness.
If drowsiness is detected, an alert will be triggered.
Code Overview
drowsiness_detection.py: The main script that initializes the camera, processes the video stream, and implements the drowsiness detection logic.
models/: Contains any pre-trained models (if applicable).
requirements.txt: Lists all necessary Python libraries for easy installation.
