# Drowsiness Detection System

## Project Title: Drowsiness Detection System Using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi

## Overview
The Drowsiness Detection System is designed to monitor a user's alertness by analyzing facial expressions and eye movements through computer vision techniques. This system utilizes OpenCV, a Raspberry Pi camera, and the Media Pi framework to detect signs of drowsiness in real-time. When drowsiness is detected, the system can alert the user through visual or auditory signals.

## Features
- Real-time detection of drowsiness
- Alerts triggered upon detection of drowsiness
- Lightweight and efficient operation on Raspberry Pi
- User-friendly interface for easy operation

## Hardware Requirements
- Raspberry Pi (any model with camera support)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module
- USB Power Supply for Raspberry Pi
- Optional: Buzzer or LED for alerts

## Software Requirements
- Raspbian OS installed on Raspberry Pi
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- NumPy library
- Mediapipe library

Installation
Set up Raspberry Pi:
Install Raspbian OS on your Raspberry Pi. Update the package list:

   ```

3. Clone the Repository:  
   Clone the project repository to your Raspberry Pi:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd drowsiness-detection
   ```

4. Connect the Camera:  
   Connect the Raspberry Pi Camera module and enable it using the Raspberry Pi Configuration settings.

5. Run the Application:  
   Execute the main script:  
   ```bash
   python3 drowsiness_detection.py
   ```

## Usage
Position the user in front of the camera. The system will begin analyzing the userâ€™s facial features for signs of drowsiness. If drowsiness is detected, an alert will be triggered.

## Code Overview
- drowsiness_detection.py: This is the main script that initializes the camera, processes the video stream, and implements the drowsiness detection logic.
- models/: This directory contains any pre-trained models, if applicable.
- requirements.txt: This file lists all necessary Python libraries for easy installation.
